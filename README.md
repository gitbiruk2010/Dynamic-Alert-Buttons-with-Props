## Introduction

This dynamic version enhances the static alert button implementation of Project A by introducing dynamic rendering of buttons. This version utilizes React's powerful state management and component reusability to generate a versatile toolbar with buttons. Each button, when clicked, displays a custom alert message. This dynamic approach allows for easier expansions or modifications compared to the static method used in Project A, showcasing a more scalable and maintainable way of developing with React.

## Features

- **Dynamic Button Rendering:** Buttons are generated dynamically from an array of properties, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
- **Customizable Alerts:** Each button can display a unique alert message, enhancing the interactivity of the application.
- **Versatile Button Text:** Button text (children) is set dynamically, providing flexibility in button labels.
